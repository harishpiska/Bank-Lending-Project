# Bank-Lending-Project

Objective was to build a model that can predict a person who takes a loan is going to be a defaulter or not in future based upon the historical data, Dataset was large with a dimension of 855969 rows & 73 columns, altogether we performed a lot of Exploratory data analysis on this data & by trying and tuning several Machine learning algorithms we conclude with tuned extratreesclassifier model performed better for predicting loan defaulter.
